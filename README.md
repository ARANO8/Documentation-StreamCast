## 1. Introduction

This project is a **live streaming platform** designed for a casino.  
The system allows authenticated users to create live broadcasts, stream from OBS, view live streams on the website, and display configurable ads during the broadcast.

The goal is to provide a smooth and secure streaming experience by integrating authentication, stream management, and ad administration into a single system.

**Main Technologies:**

* **Frontend:** React  
* **Backend:** NestJS + PostgreSQL  
* **RTMP Server:** Nginx with RTMP module  
* **Infrastructure:** Dedicated VPS  
* **Streaming Client:** OBS Studio

## 2. System Architecture

### Main Components

* **Frontend (React):**  
  Web interface that allows users to register, authenticate, create streams, and watch live content. It also includes the ads section.

* **Backend (NestJS + PostgreSQL):**  
  Handles authentication, stream creation and validation, and ad management. All user, stream, and ad data is stored in **PostgreSQL**.

* **RTMP Server (Nginx):**  
  Receives streams sent from OBS and validates the stream key with the backend before allowing publication.

* **VPS:**  
  Environment where all services are deployed (backend, frontend, and RTMP server).

## 3. User Flow

![Flow Diagram](/images/diagrama.jpg)

1. The user registers or logs in on the website.  
2. Creates a stream by entering a **name and description**.  
3. The system generates an **RTMP URL + stream key**.  
4. The user opens OBS and enters the provided configuration.  
5. When starting the stream, **Nginx RTMP** executes the `on_publish` hook, calling the backend to validate the key.  
6. If the key is valid, the stream starts and is displayed on the website.  
7. During viewing, if ads are configured, they appear according to their order and duration.
